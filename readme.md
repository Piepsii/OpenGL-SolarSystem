Course Name: Real-Time Graphics Programming for Games 1
Course Code: 5SD805 54832 HT2021
Student Name: Paul Brandstetter
Assignment Description: This is an individual assignment that consists of writing a program that simulates and renders the solar system. All planets from Mercury to Neptune should be present along with the Moon.

    All planets orbit the Sun 
    The Moon orbits Earth
    The Sun, planets and the Moon 
        Must be visible during the whole simulation
        Must spin around their own axis
        Must all be uniquely textured
        Must use the same geometry (vertex buffer)
    Geometry does not have to be spherical
Additional Comments: Planet textures were given to me by Alex Sokolov (same course) and downloaded on Pixabay
